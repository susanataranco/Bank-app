# Transaction Management Frontend - Level 2

Below, you'll find the instructions for getting started with your task. Please read them carefully to avoid unexpected issues. Best of luck!

## Time estimate

Between 2 and 3 hours, plus the time to set up the codebase.

## Mandatory steps before you get started

1. You should already have your project setup from the coding test start page but if not check out [this guide here](https://help.alvalabs.io/en/articles/9028914-how-to-set-up-the-codebase-for-your-coding-test) for more information.
2. Learn [how to get help](https://help.alvalabs.io/en/articles/9028899-how-to-ask-for-help-with-coding-tests) if you run into an issue with your coding test.

## The task

<!--TASK_INSTRUCTIONS_START-->
Your task is to build a frontend app that allows the recording of financial transactions and viewing the transaction history by connecting to a hosted Transaction Management API.

### Frontend requirements

The transaction list must display the withdrawn or deposited amount for each transaction, along with the affected account ID. It must also render the current balance for the last submitted transaction.

Here's the UI mockup with hints:

![Transaction Management App Frontend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/450319/139797772-4e4b2744-447c-411f-9b04-7028ba5e89a1.png)

Feel free to tweak the UI, but please ensure that the following HTML is in place.

#### The form for submitting transactions

```html
<form ... >
  <input data-type="account-id" ... />
  <input data-type="amount" ... />
  <input data-type="transaction-submit" type="submit" ... />
</form>
```

Both input **fields should be cleared** after the form is submitted.

#### Transactions list

Every newly submitted transaction should go on **the top of the list** and should have an enclosing `<div />` with the following structure:

```html
<div 
  data-type="transaction"
  data-account-id="${transaction-account-id}"
  data-amount="${transaction-amount}"
  data-balance="${current-account-balance}" ...>
  ...
</div>
```

- `${transaction-account-id}` - account id of the corresponding transaction.
- `${transaction-amount}` - transaction amount.
- `${current-account-balance}` - the current account balance right after submitting the transaction (only show for the last submitted transaction).

### The API to integrate with

<details>
<summary>Untoggle to see request examples</summary>

##### Get historical transactions

```
GET https://infra.devskills.app/api/accounting/transactions
```

##### Create a new transaction

```
POST https://infra.devskills.app/api/accounting/transaction
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "account_id": "0afd02d3-6c59-46e7-b7bc-893c5e0b7ac2",
  "amount": 7
}
```

##### Get a transaction by id

```
GET https://infra.devskills.app/api/accounting/transactions/7c94635a-40a3-4c87-888a-42c3ce5b9750
```

##### Get an account by id
```
GET https://infra.devskills.app/api/accounting/accounts/0afd02d3-6c59-46e7-b7bc-893c5e0b7ac2
```

</details>

### Solution expectations

- Do your best to make the [provided E2E tests](cypress/e2e/test.cy.js) pass. Check out [this tutorial](https://help.alvalabs.io/en/articles/9028831-how-to-work-with-cypress) to learn how to execute these tests and analyze the results.
- Implement client-side validation of the form data.
- Implement error handling for the cases when the API cannot be reached or returns a server error.
- Unit test one module of choice. There is no need to test the whole app, as we only want to understand what you take into consideration when writing unit tests.
- Avoid duplication and extract re-usable modules where it makes sense. We want to see your approach to creating a codebase that is easy to maintain.

<!--TASK_INSTRUCTIONS_END-->
## When you are done

1. [Create a new Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from the branch where you've committed your solution to the default branch of this repository. **Please do not merge the created Pull Request**.
2. Go to your application in [Alva Labs](https://app.alvalabs.io) and submit your test.
